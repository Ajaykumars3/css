    <h1>Mobile phone</h1>
    <p class="st">A mobile phone, cellular phone, cell phone, cellphone, handphone, or hand phone, sometimes shortened to simply mobile,
    cell, or just phone, is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user
    is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of
    a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone
    services use a cellular network</p>
